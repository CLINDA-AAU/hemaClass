Installation
------------
If you wish to install the latest version of `hemaClass` directly from the master branch here at GitHub, run 

```R
# Install necessary packages 

# First form bioconductor
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("affy")
biocLite("affyio")
biocLite("preprocessCore")

# Then form CRAN
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("matrixStats")
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("RcppArmadillo")
install.packages("RcppEigen")
install.packages("testthat")

# Finally the package is installed.
#install.packages("devtools")  # Uncomment if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("Falgreen/hemaClass", 
                         auth_token = "...", 
                         dependencies = TRUE)
```

`hemaClass` is still under heavy development and should be considered unstable. Be sure that you have the [package development prerequisites](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites) if you wish to install the package from the source.

modifications!
