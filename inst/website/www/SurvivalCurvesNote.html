      <strong>*NOTE:</strong> 
      The predicted survival curves and given probabilies are based on a pooled 
      dataset of studies LLMPP, MDFCI, and IDRC. Thus, the user supplied
      patients should bear some resemblance to the patients of these studies 
      in order for the predicted probabilities to be well-calibrated.
