      <strong>*NOTE:</strong> 
      The predicted survival curves and probabilities are based on a pooled 
      dataset of the studies LLMPP, MDFCI, and IDRC. Thus, it is assumed that             the user supplied
      patients bear resemblance to the patients of these studies 
      in order for the predicted probabilities to be well-calibrated.
