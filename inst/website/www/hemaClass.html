<h1>Welcome to <strong>hemaClass.org</strong></h1>
<p> 
  This website provides classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
  (DLBCL) and multiple myeloma (MM) patients according to 
  various classifications algorithms based on gene expression profiles (GEP). 
  The server currently supports gene expressions profiled by the Affymetrix 
  GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
